### Attached files

### Summary
I used base 32 decode and base 64 decode

### Detailed solution
[Provide the detailed solution of the ctf here.]
Some rules:
Name of tool, name of file, name of functions, etc: put in 1 set of backtick:  `name of something`
Code snippet, console output, other long multilines of text: put in 3 sets of backticks on a new line: 
```code snippet```
Key ideas, name of person who invented the method, etc: put in bold **name of someone**
